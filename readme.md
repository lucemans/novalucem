# New Dawn (NovaLucem)
Novalucem is a server-run kubernetes hosting platform with the main intent to integrate into the CI/CD workflow of beginning and intermediate developers.
It does so through the means of simplification, as soon as a user creates a project they will be granted their their docker login credentials.
As soon as a docker container is pushed automatic kubernetes config files are created and run. The user is able to choose ports and connect their domains.
Through the panel they can monitor their logs, container statuses, and configure hardware limitations.

Users are capable of logging in with their github account, and are able to easily automate the deployment of their docker containers.

## State
This project is still heavily work in progress and only the basic features work so far

### So what does work?
Currently I have a system in place for automated deployment as soon as a docker image is pushed,
### So whats up next?
User accounts, a way to monitor logs, and a way for users to create new projects
